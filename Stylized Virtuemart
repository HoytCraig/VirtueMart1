Thanks to the new Themes features in Virtuemart we can offer you for the first time a custom Virtuemart theme! This theme contains our own customized Virtuemart files. These files are shown on this demo and it is highly recommended that you implement them.


How To Setup The Theme:

    Download the file shape5_aluma_photography_vm_10.zip from the Aluma Photography download section
    Extract the contents of that zip file to components/com_virtuemart/themes/
    Login to the backend of Joomla
    Navigate to Components/Virtuemart
    On the Virtuemart Menu click Admin/Configuration
    Click the Site tab
    Under the drop down Select The Theme For Your Shop select s5_aluma_photography
    Right below that area select managed for Category Template and flypage.tpl for Flypage
    Click Save in the upper right
    Navigate back to the same drop down and click Configuration just beside where it says s5_aluma_photography
    Adjust the settings as desired. We recommend leaving the settings how they are for design reasons. Click Save when you're done
